Remove Duplicate Numbers

Given a list of integers nums, remove numbers that appear multiple times in the list, while maintaining order of the appearance in the original list.
It should use O(k) space where k is the number of unique integers.

Constraints
    n â‰¤ 100,000 where n is the length of nums

Example 1

Input
nums = [1, 3, 5, 0, 3, 5, 8]

Output
[1, 0, 8]

Explanation
Only [1, 0, 8] are unique in the list and that's the order they appear in.
