# 365-Days-of-Python-and-ML
Creating a Repo for Continuous practice towards Python Exercises and ML Exercises once a week. 


- 6 days awesome Python Practice on random logical questions and,
- 7th Day one ML Use case which can be carries over if needed.
- Based on my availability and some spare time, will be adding some bonus questions/topics. For example, Sorting in Python/Linked List concept in Python, etc.

Star it/ Fork it and contribute with questions.

For any query/issues, you are welcome to open an issue.

### ***Day 1:***

*Write a function that will return the count of distinct case-insensitive alphabetic characters and numeric digits that occur more than once in the input string. The input string can be assumed to contain only alphabets (both uppercase and lowercase) and numeric digits.*

### ***Day 2:***

*Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.*

### ***Day 3:***

*POSITIVE or NEGATIVE ?
If the blood composition of the person is a subsequence of the virus composition V, then the person is identified as POSITIVE otherwise NEGATIVE.*

### ***Day 4:***

*Given a right angled triangle ABC, right angled at B. Find angle ABD, where D is the mid-point of the hypotenuse(side AC).*

### ***Day 5:***

*Given a list of integers prices representing prices of cars for sale, and a budget k, return the maximum number of cars you can buy.*

### ***Day 6:***

*A newly opened multinational brand has decided to base their company logo on the three most common characters in the company name. They are now trying out various combinations of company names and logos based on this condition. Given a string, which is the company name in lowercase letters, your task is to find the top three most common characters in the string.*

### ***Day 7:***

*ML Challenge:*
  - *Stock Price Prediction*
  - *Future Predictions*
  - *Final Results*

### ***Day 8:***

*Longest Consecutive Duplicate String -> Given a lowercase alphabet string s, return the length of the longest substring with same characters.*

### ***Day 9:***

*Palindromic Integer*

### ***Day 10:***

*UGLY NUMBER -> Given an integer n, return whether its prime factors only include 2, 3 or 5.*

### ***Day 11:***

*No Idea! -> There is an array of n integers. There are also 2 disjoint sets,A and B, each containing integers. You like all the integers in set A and dislike all the integers in set B. Your initial happiness is 0. For each i integer in the array, if ,i belongs A you add 1 to your happiness. If i belongs to B, you add -1 to your happiness. Otherwise, your happiness does not change. Output your final happiness at the end.*

### ***Day 12:***

*SUBARRAY DIVISION -> Two children, Lily and Ron, want to share a chocolate bar. Each of the squares has an integer on it.*
*Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that:*

    The length of the segment matches Ron's birth month, and,
    The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day.

*Determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.*

### ***Day 13:***

*BILL DIVISION -> Two friends Anna and Brian, are deciding how to split the bill at a dinner. Each will only pay for the items they consume. Brian gets the check and calculates Anna's portion. You must determine if his calculation is correct.*

*For example, assume the bill has the following prices: bill = [2,4,6]. Anna declines to eat item k = bill[2] which costs 6. If Brian calculates the bill correctly, Anna will pay (2+4)/2=3. If he includes the cost of bill[2], he will calculate (2+4+2)/2=6. In the second case, he should refund to 3 Anna.*

### ***Day 14:***
